# ---------------------------------------
# Define an annotation task
# This includes:
# 1. a name (e.g., building_simple or rail_space, see below)
# 2. a list of labels to be used for this task
# ---------------------------------------
tasks:
  phenotype_test:
    labels: ["No", "Plant"]

# ---------------------------------------
# paths
# You need to specify:
# 1. a name (e.g., task_test_one_inch_maps_001, see below)
# 2. patch_paths: path to all the patches to be annotated
# 3. parent_paths: path to the original/parent maps/images (which were patchified)
# 4. annot_dir: directory in which the outputs will be stored
# ---------------------------------------
paths:
  task_test_phenotype:
    patch_paths: "./patches_50_pixel/*png"
    parent_paths: "./dataset/open_access_plant/*png"
    annot_dir: "./annotations_phenotype_open_access"
